Legendary West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop engaged in cheeky banter with his commentary colleagues during the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) and called some of them extremely 'pro-CSK'. Bishop was having a conversation with Ambati Rayudu and he went on to namedrop Rayudu, Matthew Hayden, and Shane Watson while saying that sometimes their opinions are extremely biased when the topic is their former team - Chennai Super Kings. It has not been a good start to the campaign for CSK as they have won just one out of their first four matches in this year's competition.
