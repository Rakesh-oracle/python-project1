The Saga of Dasharatha
Long ago, in the glorious kingdom of Ayodhya, there ruled a righteous king named Dasharatha. 
Known for his valor and devotion, Dasharatha was beloved by his subjects and renowned as one of the greatest emperors of the Ikshvaku dynasty. 
Yet, beneath the gilded crown lay a man whose life intertwined with destiny and sacrifice.
Dasharatha had three queens—Kaushalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi—but despite his wealth and power,
he longed for an heir to carry forward the legacy of Ayodhya.
Seeking divine intervention, he performed the Putrakameshti Yagna, a sacred ritual to invoke blessings for children. 
The gods answered his prayers, and soon, his queens bore him four sons: Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna.
Dasharatha's joy knew no bounds as his sons grew into virtuous and noble warriors.
Among his sons, Rama shone brightest, embodying dharma (righteousness) and wisdom. 
Dasharatha’s heart swelled with pride as he decided to crown Rama as the prince regent of Ayodhya.
However, fate had other plans. Queen Kaikeyi, manipulated by her maid Manthara, invoked two boons Dasharatha had once promised her. 
She demanded that Rama be sent into exile for fourteen years and that her son Bharata be crowned instead.
Dasharatha was shattered. Bound by his promise to Kaikeyi, he was forced to banish his beloved Rama. 
His grief was immeasurable, and the once-strong king broke under the weight of sorrow. 
Unable to bear the separation, Dasharatha passed away, leaving Ayodhya in turmoil.
Rama, true to his father’s teachings, embraced his exile with grace and upheld dharma, even in the face of adversity. 
Dasharatha’s legacy lived on through Rama's deeds, 
as he triumphed over evil, defeated the demon king Ravana, 
and returned to Ayodhya to restore justice and harmony.
